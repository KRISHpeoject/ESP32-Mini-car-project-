ESP32 Bluetooth Controlled Car

This project showcases a simple and efficient four-wheel car built using the ESP32 microcontroller, the TB6612FNG motor driver, and two small DC N20 gear motors. The car is fully controlled via Bluetooth using a smartphone.

ðŸ”§ Hardware Overview

Microcontroller: ESP32 (with Bluetooth capability)

Motor Driver: TB6612FNG Dual H-Bridge

Motors: 2 Ã— N20 DC gear motors

Front Wheel: using dummy Motor gear box and wheel

Power Supply: 3.7 volt battery 

Motor Driver VM: 3.7-5.0V one Li-ion battery


Bluetooth Communication: Uses BluetoothSerial library

Control Method: Smartphone app or Bluetooth terminal (commands: F, B, L, R, S, 1â€“4)


ðŸ“¦ Features

Forward / Backward Movement: Both motors run at the same speed

Turning Left / Right: One motor is stopped while the other runs

Stop Command: Both motors stop instantly

Speed Control: 4 levels (100, 150, 200, 255 PWM)


ðŸ§  How It Works

Commands are sent via Bluetooth from the smartphone. The ESP32 receives characters and maps them to motor actions using the TB6612FNG driver.
